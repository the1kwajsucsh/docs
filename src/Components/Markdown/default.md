# Hello world!

Don't disregard it because it's cute. It has quite the claws, lots of time was spent to deal with common pitfalls, like the dreaded zombie child problem, react concurrency, and context loss between mixed renderers. It may be the one state-manager in the React space that gets all of these right.

```js
import React from "react";
import MarkdownFile from "../Markdown/MarkdownFile";

const R3fIndex = () => {

  return (
    <MarkdownFile/>
  )
};

export default R3fIndex;
```
